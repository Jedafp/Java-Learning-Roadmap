<h2>Roadmap to Learn Java</h2>

Java is a versatile, object-oriented language widely used for backend development, Android apps, and enterprise systems. This roadmap takes you from absolute beginner to advanced, focusing exclusively on free resources. Practice consistently by coding daily—use online compilers like JDoodle or Replit if you don't want to install anything initially.
Phase 1: Setup and Basics (1-2 weeks)
Get your environment ready and learn fundamental programming concepts.

Install JDK and IDE:
Download the latest JDK (Java 21+ recommended) from Oracle's site (free for development).
Use a free IDE: IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition, Eclipse, or VS Code with Java extensions.

Core Topics: Variables, data types, operators, control structures (if-else, loops), basic input/output.
Free Resources:
Oracle's Official Java Tutorials: Start with "Getting Started" and "Learning the Java Language" trails at https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/ (excellent for basics, though some examples are older—focus on concepts).
W3Schools Java Tutorial: https://www.w3schools.com/java/ (interactive, beginner-friendly with try-it-yourself editor).
freeCodeCamp's Java section or YouTube intros for quick overviews.


Practice: Write simple programs like calculators or number guessers.
Phase 2: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Fundamentals (3-4 weeks)
Java is OOP-centric—master this early.

Topics: Classes, objects, methods, constructors, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction, interfaces, packages.
Free Resources:
Continue with Oracle Java Tutorials: "Language Basics" and "Classes and Objects" sections.
University of Helsinki MOOC: Java Programming I (highly recommended—free, comprehensive, with hundreds of exercises). Register at https://java-programming.mooc.fi/ (Part I covers OOP solidly).
YouTube: Bro Code's full Java course (free, 10+ hours) or Alex Lee's Java playlist for visual explanations.


Practice: Build small projects like a bank account system or simple game using classes.
Phase 3: Core Java (Intermediate) (4-6 weeks)
Dive deeper into Java's standard libraries.

Topics: Arrays, strings, exception handling, collections (List, Set, Map), generics, file I/O, multithreading basics, lambda expressions (Java 8+ features like Streams).
Free Resources:
University of Helsinki MOOC: Java Programming II (continues from Part I, covers collections, exceptions, and more advanced OOP).
Oracle Tutorials: Trails on "Collections", "Exceptions", "Generics", and "I/O Streams".
GeeksforGeeks Java section (free articles and examples) or JavaTpoint for reference.
YouTube: freeCodeCamp's full Java course or Telusko's Java series.


Practice: Work on projects like a to-do list app, file reader/writer, or basic multithreaded programs. Solve problems on HackerRank or LeetCode (Java track).
Phase 4: Advanced Java (4-8 weeks)
Modern features and best practices.

Topics: Advanced Streams API, concurrency (Executors, Fork/Join), enums, annotations, reflection, JVM internals basics, new features (records, sealed classes, pattern matching from Java 17+).
Free Resources:
Dev.java (Oracle's modern learning hub): Updated tutorials on latest features at https://dev.java/learn/.
Roadmap.sh Java: Visual guide with links to free resources.
YouTube: Amigoscode or Java Brains for advanced topics.
Official Java release notes for features post-Java 8.


Practice: Refactor earlier projects with lambdas/Streams. Explore open-source Java repos on GitHub.
Phase 5: Tools, Testing, and Real-World Application (Ongoing)
Become job-ready.

Topics: Git/version control, build tools (Maven/Gradle basics), unit testing (JUnit), debugging.
Free Resources:
Git: Official Git tutorial (free).
Maven: Official docs or free YouTube intros.
Testing: Oracle tutorials on JUnit or freeCodeCamp videos.
Full roadmap reference: GitHub repos like hiten-codes/Java-Developer-Roadmap (lists free resources).


Projects (Essential for all phases):

Beginner: Console-based tic-tac-toe, ATM simulator.
Intermediate: Library management system, chat application.
Advanced: REST API with JSON handling, multi-threaded server.

Tips for Success

Daily Practice: Code every day—aim for 100+ LeetCode/HackerRank problems in Java.
Community: Join r/learnjava on Reddit or Stack Overflow for help.
Stay Updated: Java evolves (current LTS: Java 21). Check dev.java for news.
Time Estimate: 3-6 months for solid proficiency, depending on daily effort (2-4 hours/day).

This roadmap uses timeless free resources that are still highly relevant in 2026. Start with the Helsinki MOOC or Oracle tutorials—they're the gold standard for free learning. Happy coding!
